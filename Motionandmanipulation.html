         AI is heavily used in robotics.
         Advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories,
         can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.
         A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment;
        however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient's breathing body,
        pose a greater challenge. Motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into "primitives"
        such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant motion,
        a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object.
        Moravec's paradox generalizes that low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are,
        counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named after Hans Moravec,
        who stated in 1988 that "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers,
         and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility".
         This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years.
